    "We are analyzing what kinds of players contribute the most to sessions, particularly their experience levels and gender.  We want to know “Can we predict the gender of these players based on their experience and hours played on the server by k nearest neighbours classification?” Gender is our variable of interest, and experience and hours played are our explanatory variables from the players dataset. Hours played allows us to filter for those that contributed the most to Plaicraft, and experience and gender summarize what “kind” of player they are. Understanding this allows marketing to allocate resources towards this demographic to maximize sales and usage."

The data we are planning to work with is already tidy, however it is likely we will need to remove outliers and “zeros” in the dataset.  While exploring, we will use a bar plot. "
